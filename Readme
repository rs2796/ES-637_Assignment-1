Important points:
There are three matlab files for this assignment.
These are:
1)assignment-1main.m
2)loadtrainingimages.m
3)loadtsestimages.m
loadtrainingimages.m is for laoding the training images.
loadtestimages.m is for laoding the test images.

Run the assignment-1main in matlab.

You will be asked to input the number of eigen faces.

Output:
	The code will display every test image and the closest training image with respect to the test image and at the end you will get the efficiency of the algorithm.
